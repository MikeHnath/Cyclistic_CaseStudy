## Final Recommendations

Based on the analysis of Q1 2019 and Q1 2020 Cyclistic trip data, the following three recommendations are proposed to increase annual memberships:

---

### 1. Target High-Frequency Casual Riders with Cost-Saving Messaging
- Identify casual riders who take 3+ rides per month.
- Use targeted email campaigns and in-app notifications to show how much they could save annually with a membership.
- Include easy one-click membership sign-up links.

---

### 2. Convert Weekend Riders to Weekday Commuters
- Create “Weekend-to-Weekday Challenge” promotions where casuals earn free weekday rides after a certain number of weekend rides.
- Highlight benefits of weekday commuting via bike: convenience, speed, cost savings, environmental impact.
- Partner with local employers to offer discounted memberships to employees.

---

### 3. Launch Geo-Targeted Digital Ads in Leisure Hotspots
- Use location-based ads near popular weekend destinations and high-use docking stations.
- Promote on-the-spot membership discounts or bundle offers for families and friends.
- Run seasonal campaigns in spring/summer to capture riders at peak leisure times.

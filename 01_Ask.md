## Business Task
Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-share company, wants to increase the number of annual memberships because they are more profitable than single-ride or day passes. The marketing director believes the company’s future success depends on converting casual riders into annual members.

As a junior data analyst on the marketing analytics team, my role is to determine **how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently**. These insights will help the marketing team design strategies that encourage casual riders to purchase memberships.

## Guiding Questions for the Marketing Program

2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
